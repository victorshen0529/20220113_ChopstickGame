Chopstick Game

This program allows a player to play Chopstick Game against the Computer. 

Rules:
Both computer and human players have two hands initially.  
Human starts the game first by using one of the hand to attack one of computer's hand.  
Computer will add your one finger to its exisiting fingers and extend the sum of the two.
On the next turn, computer uses its hand attack you. You now have to add its number to your
existing fingers on the attacked hand.
Take turns between players to attack each other’s hands.
When a player's hand reaches five fingers or more, that hand is considered "dead" 
and is no longer in play.
You can use your turn to switch to redistribute the number of fingers. 
You can also switch number to your ‘dead’ hand to bring it back.
The player loses if both hands are ‘dead’ 

Rules and pictures are adopted and edited from http://www.wikihow.com/Play-Chopsticks
